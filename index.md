# Basics of Data Visualization

This workshop provides an overview of the principles and practices of data visualization. We are going to cover some of the most commonly used approaches and techniques on making clear visuals from messy data.<br>

This is an introductory level workshop that ***does not require any programming knowledge or experience with a specific software***. However, we also have workshops that introduce how to work with popular visualization tools, including [R](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/data-analysis-r/visualization/introduction.html) and [Tableau](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-data-viz/).

 
## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
1. choose right visualization type for your task
2. make your graph easy interpretable and neat looking
3. tell a story using data
